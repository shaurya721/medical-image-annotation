## Deployment

The app can be deployed to various platforms. Below are the steps for deploying to popular free hosting services:

### Vercel

1. Push the project to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and link the GitHub repository.
3. Vercel automatically detects the Nuxt.js app and deploys it.

### Netlify

1. Push the project to GitHub.
2. Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and link the GitHub repository.
3. Configure the build settings for Nuxt.js (e.g., build command: `npm run build`).
4. Deploy the app and get the live URL.

### GitHub Pages

1. Push the build folder to the `gh-pages` branch of the GitHub repository.
2. Follow the instructions provided by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to deploy.

## Files and Directories

### Key Files

- **`nuxt.config.ts`**: Nuxt.js configuration file.
- **`package.json`**: Contains the dependencies and scripts for the project.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines the Docker setup for the application.
- **`assets/css/tailwind.css`**: Custom Tailwind CSS file.
- **`pages/index.vue`**: The main page of the application.

### Key Directories

- **`components/`**: Contains reusable components.
- **`pages/`**: Contains the pages of the app.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Error: "docker-compose command not found"**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on the machine.
- **Nuxt.js not working**: If the app doesn't load, try stopping the Docker container and restarting it using `docker-compose down` and then `docker-compose up`.

### Debugging

1. **Check Docker Logs**: If there are issues starting the app, review the Docker logs for any error messages:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs
    ```

2. **Console Errors**: Open the browser's developer tools (F12) and check for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing the app from loading correctly.
